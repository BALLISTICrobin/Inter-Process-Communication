# üßµ Interprocess Communication (IPC)

## üîç What is IPC?

**Interprocess Communication (IPC)** refers to the techniques used for **exchanging data and coordinating actions between multiple processes** in an operating system. It allows independent or cooperating processes to work together efficiently.

IPC is essential for:

- **Information sharing** between processes
- **Synchronization** to avoid race conditions
- **Resource management** in concurrent systems

## üõ†Ô∏è Common IPC Mechanisms

- **Shared Memory**: Processes access a common memory space.
- **Message Passing**: Data is sent using system calls like `send()` and `receive()`.
- **Semaphores**: Used for synchronization and mutual exclusion (e.g., producer-consumer problem).
- **Monitors**: High-level abstraction for safe access to shared resources.
- **Pipes**: Unidirectional communication channel, often used in shell pipelines.

## üí° Why IPC Matters

Without proper IPC, processes can:

- Overwrite each other‚Äôs data
- Deadlock waiting for resources
- Miss critical updates or signals

Efficient IPC ensures system **stability, performance, and correctness** in multi-processing environments.
